`open-computer-use` is an open-source `Computer Use` service exposed over `MCP`, so any AI agent or MCP client can call it directly and use computer interaction capabilities on macOS.

This project was inspired by OpenAI's recently released [Codex Computer Use](https://openai.com/index/codex-for-almost-everything/). It showed that non-intrusive CUA can be built on top of macOS Accessibility, which is why I decided to build an open-source version.

I bootstrapped this repo with my earlier [harness template](https://github.com/iFurySt/harness-template). It is a template for spinning up an AI-oriented repository quickly, especially for projects that are close to 100% AI-generated. This has been one of our most useful workflows over the past month, and it now lets us ship new ideas very quickly. If you are interested, I also wrote [a post](https://www.ifuryst.com/blog/2026/speedrunning-the-ai-era/) about the methodology behind it.

## Quick Start

Install it globally first:

```bash
npm i -g open-computer-use
```

Before first use, grant macOS `Accessibility` and `Screen Recording` permission to the `Open Computer Use.app` installed by `npm install -g open-computer-use`. That global npm install location should be treated as the long-term stable permission target. The development copy at `dist/Open Computer Use.app` should only be used as a local debugging fallback, not as the long-term app identity. If you are not sure about the current state, run:

```bash
open-computer-use
```

Then add it to your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-computer-use": {
      "command": "open-computer-use",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## More

Besides using the MCP JSON config above, you can also use the built-in subcommands:

```bash
# Install into Claude Code by writing to ~/.claude.json
open-computer-use install-claude-mcp
# Install into Codex by writing to ~/.codex/config.toml
open-computer-use install-codex-mcp
# Install as a Codex plugin, mainly for Codex App usage; if you use this, you usually do not need install-codex-mcp as well
open-computer-use install-codex-plugin
# Start the MCP server directly
open-computer-use mcp
# Check permissions; onboarding only opens when something is missing
open-computer-use doctor
# Show help
open-computer-use -h
```

## Cursor Demos

This repo now includes two standalone cursor-motion demos so the reconstructed model and the more speculative lab work can evolve separately:

```bash
swift run StandaloneCursor
swift run StandaloneCursorLab
```

- [`experiments/StandaloneCursor`](./experiments/StandaloneCursor) is the cleaner binary-guided viewer built directly from `scripts/cursor-motion-re/official_cursor_motion.py`. It focuses on the recovered 20-candidate pool, score model, and raw spring timeline.
- [`experiments/StandaloneCursorLab`](./experiments/StandaloneCursorLab) remains the more experimental lab for UI-heavy tuning, candidate overlays, and visual-dynamics exploration.
